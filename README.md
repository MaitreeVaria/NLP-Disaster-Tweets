# NLP-Disaster-Tweets

This Jupyter Notebook explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets related to disasters. NLP plays a crucial role in understanding the sentiment and content of tweets during emergency situations.

**Note:** This notebook is a part of a Cousera course - [Introduction to Deep Learning : Week 4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-deep-learning-boulder)


In this notebook, we will:

- **Load and preprocess the tweet data**: We'll start by loading and cleaning the tweet data, preparing it for analysis.

- **Perform NLP tasks**: We'll delve into various NLP tasks, including text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.

- **Visualize the results**: The notebook will showcase visualizations to gain insights into disaster-related tweets.

- **Provide explanations and insights**: Along the way, we'll explain the code and provide insights into the analysis and the impact of NLP in disaster response.
